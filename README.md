# TinderSwipeBot

TinderSwipeBot is a Python script that automates the login process and performs auto-swiping on Tinder. With this bot, you can automatically swipe right (like) or left (dislike) on profiles up to 100 times (the maximum allowed in a day on Tinder). The script is designed to be run on PythonAnywhere, a cloud-based Python development and hosting environment, making it convenient to schedule and execute the bot daily.

Introduction

TinderSwipeBot saves you time by automating the repetitive process of logging into Tinder and swiping through profiles. It uses the Tinder API (Application Programming Interface) to perform swipes and requires minimal configuration to get started.
